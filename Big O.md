# Big O Notation

## Task 0

This code takes O(1) to run because of accessing data in a Python list has O(1), and there are 2 lines in the code that does this.

- Time complexity: O(1)

## Task 1

My code takes O(n) time in task 1 because of the 2 for loops.

- Time complexity: O(n)

## Task 2

This takes O(n), as many operations are O(1) or O(n), but because we take the highest time complexity, the time is O(n).

- Time complexity: O(n)

## Task 3

This code takes O(n log n), because of using Python's built-in sorting operations. Also, there is O(n) scans through the list, but we keep the highest time complexity, O(n log n).

- Time complexity: O(n log n)

## Task 4

This code takes O(n log n), because of using Python's built-in sorting operations. Also, there is O(1) operations, but we keep the highest time complexity, O(n log n).

- Time complexity: O(n log n)
